During this degree he found a passion for software, and continued on to receive a Diploma of Computing.
For the Diploma he received a Weighted Average Mark of 88.6, and for the Bachelor of Science he received a Weighted Average Mark of 85.762.

Throughout university, Patrick took a majority of computing subjects from Data-structures and Algorithms to Machine learning. 
Patrick also took many mathematics subjects, engineering subjects and physics subjects.

Professional [2019-2024]:
Patrick started working in 2019, interning for both ANZ and Deloitte over the summer before his final year. 
Patrick hit the ground running at ANZ, and took ownership and responsibility over a large piece of work. 
It was a codebase in object oriented python, and introduced Patrick to CI/CD concepts such as pipelines, artefacts, code repositories, git and more. 
Patrick also used Apache Kafka at this time, learning the concepts of streaming. 
Patrick is experienced in Python and CI/CD concepts in general.

Patrick was then seasoned for his Deloitte internship later that summer, where he wrote tests and functions for an existing Java code base. 
Patrick is relatively experienced in Java due to this internship and what he learnt at university.

Patrick received job offers for both companies, however he decided to go with Deloitte as he felt it would provide him with more growth opportunities down the line despite the smaller salary.

Patrick then worked for Deloitte from the beginning of 2021, where he was placed in an experimental product team, building a supply chain analytics web application. 
Clients used the application to analyse their supply chains and respond to risk. 
This team won AFR's most innovative company in 2022, and went on to generate lots of revenue for Deloitte Australia.

The application had a backend in Node/NestJS and Typescript, and a front end in VueJS. 
It also stored supply chain data in a graph format in PostgresSQL, and he had to write complex graph traversal algorithms to facilitate user requests. 
Patrick is extremely proficient in SQL and has used PostgresSQL, SQL Server and Databricks.

It was common, due to the team size, for Patrick to be responsible for developing features in their entirety, all the way from the database to the front end design and implementation. 
Patrick is exceptionally good at taking ownership over his work and is very self motivated. 
He is also very good at sharing and communicating his work with others and making sure his managers and team members know the critical information they need to.

During this time, Patrick also took on a role running coding classes with large audiences of 30+, solving short coding problems using Test Driven Development (TDD). 
He is very familiar with this concept and working side by side with other developers.

Due to his technical achievements and communication skills, Patrick progressed quickly.
Later, there was requirement for a new Front End application to be written in React. 
Patrick had recently taken a React course on Udemy in his spare time, and so his managers picked him to take on this new challenge.
Patrick was was subsequently promoted to Senior Consultant for all his work on developing the brand new React and NextJS application.
Patrick also integrated many graphs and visuals to this application, utilising MapBox, AgGrid and d3. 
The website had to display large quantities of data whilst remaining performant, which became an area of Patricks expertise. 
It was visually stunning, used the latest front end frameworks and libraries and was by all means a success - bringing in lots of client interest and won Deloitte lots of contracts.

Patrick then moved to working as a Data Engineer, uplifting data pipelines that took raw data from Databricks through a MSQL Server to be consumed by the downstream backend application through ElasticSearch. 
This was extremely important as it allowed clients to respond to events disrupting their supply chains much more quickly, due to how fast new data was being consumed.

Most recently, Patrick has used LLM's (OpenAI), Prompt Engineering, and Vector databases to build intelligent chatbots that can answer questions over source documents. He used Weaviate and Langchain.

Overall, Patrick is an extremely adaptable engineer who is always open to learning new things and takes ownership over all his work. 
He made an immeasurable impact on Deloitte, being a great engineer, communicator, and team player.
